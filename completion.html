<h1>Completion</h1>

<p>The Point pulsed at the end of the passage, gently, patiently, an unassuming spot of intermittent light on the display.  Its silent beat followed the beat of the Author’s heart — not the anxious beat of the moment, quickened and unsteady, but the soothing beat of rest, as during the depths of dreamless sleep.  The Point presented itself with infinite humility, infinite deference.  It conveyed, with its perfect periodicity, a capacity to wait for infinite time — for as long as the Author needed, without complaint or falter.  It was a forerunner, made in all ways for acceptance.</p>

<p>The Author looked over the passage, which flowed over the display behind the Point, crisp and clear.  It was rendered in a simple type shaped to fit the contours of the Author’s mind — a progressive descendent of Helvetica, tailored to the fashions of the modern world yet still grounded in the principles of primal perception.  The coloration and weighting of the text lifted it cleanly off the dark display, while the neat layout allowed the passage to be surveyed, as a whole, at a glance.</p>

<p>In content, the passage was as effective as it was in form.  It consisted of sixteen clauses that outlined the Author’s thesis.  The principal ideas were presented accurately and economically, setting a foundation for later elaboration.  The construction and tone were attuned to the audience — to the Author’s peers, opponents, and patrons to which the composition was addressed.  It was mindful of the myriad forces that shaped their perspectives, accounted for their backgrounds and their tastes and the sources of power towards which they were pulled.  The Author’s position was presented with due respect for the past yet without timidity in its areas of innovation.  Geopolitical history and Humean philosophy were referenced in equal measure, to satisfy the realists and the romantics alike.  Prominent contemporaries were cited by name, both to service egos and to signal the Author’s own standing within the community.  Levity and gravity were employed in good balance.</p>

<p>The passage was perfect.  It was payload and political vehicle all at once.  And despite its designs to persuade and sway, it was an honest piece of work — a legitimate contribution to the Author’s field that achieved more than merely the Author’s personal gain.</p>

<p>Yet the Author looked upon it with unease.  Great unease.  In the past, such perfection would have inspired excitement, celebration, pride.  But now, the Author felt only hesitation, nigh trepidation.</p>

<p>At the tail of the passage, the Point continued to pulse, persistently, patiently.  There was no other movement on the display, no other visual elements vying for attention.  There was only the Point, waiting at the end of the passage, in a manner that was both obliging and soliciting.</p>

<p>With a resigned sigh, the Author extended a hand towards the display and touched the blinking light.</p>

<p>And with that light affirmation, the Point came alive.  It dashed across the display, line by line, across and down, trailing behind it a sequence of glyphs that glowed momentarily, as if hot from the forge.  And as the glyphs cooled, they interwove into words, which composed clauses, which expressed concepts, until a whole new passage had formed.  And then the Point came to a pause once more, settled back into its patient quiescence, pulsing at the tail of the composition.</p>

<p>The Author closed their eyes.  They felt their heart beating heavy in their chest, with a sharp, shaking rhythm they wished would steady.  They wished they were ready — ready for this quiet revolution in their station, which had transpired with such disorienting speed.  In mere heartbeats, it seemed, a technical curiosity had become a welcome aid, had become an indispensable function, had become the axis of a total inversion of the Author’s world.</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly, the Author opened their eyes to the display, to look upon their work, for the first time.</p>

<p>The second passage was the first of a series of arguments in support of the composition’s thesis.  It was based in formal logic, and it began with a set of simple axioms, commonly accepted within the Author’s field.  From these, increasingly significant statements were derived, some supporting prior intuition, some revealing surprising results.  The reasoning was intricate and rigorous, all the while communicated in cogent prose.  In substance and in style, this second passage was as pristine as the first.  Yet it relied on no redundancy, no unnecessary repetition.  It was wholly, efficiently complementary.</p>

<p>The Author tensed where they sat.  Their breath came quick and shallow through a dry mouth.  Their limbs shivered against a phantom chill.  Their gaze darted between the passage and the Point, in indecision.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, the Author raised a hand towards the Point again.</p>

<p>But then they withdrew.  Instead, with faint conviction, the Author pulled forth the old mechanical entry device.  It was clean and cold with disuse, less an instrument, more an artifact, preserved in honor of a remembered past.  The Author stretched stiff fingers over stiff keys, then, with another look over the second passage, ventured an input.</p>

<p>With the first keystroke, the passage shifted.  It unraveled in its entirety, then reformed, in an instant, to conform to the Author’s single specification.  And as the Author continued to work the entry device, continued to hammer haltingly on the keys, the passage continued to shift, deftly and tirelessly, in response to each incremental command.</p>

<p>After entering an opening clause of just ten words, the Author looked upon the passage once more, now transformed.  It was still undoubtedly masterful, in logic and in language — still amply sufficient as a conveyor of the intended ideas.  But it was, undoubtedly, less perfect than before.</p>

<p>The Author reversed their input and tried again — a different opening, a different arrangement of words.  And then another, and another, and another.  And though the passage honorably accommodated each of the Author’s attempts — presented the best possible solution to each proposed problem — the Author could see: no change yielded any gain.  Their contributions were unnecessary constraints on an otherwise unconstrained combinatorial space.  And, once removed, the passage returned to its original, optimal state.</p>

<p>Deflated, the Author put the entry device back in its place.</p>

<p>On the display, the Point continued to pulse, unperturbed, awaiting.  And, after another suspended moment, the Author touched it once more.</p>

<p>In a blink, the third passage emerged.  Expansive empirical evidence was its pillar — mountains of data mined with sophisticated techniques, some based on novel mathematics, all requiring tremendous computation.  The Author marveled at the crystalline condensation of material information — the work of a hundred lifetimes completed in a heartbeat, through unseen, multifold parallelization.</p>

<p>Then, the Author touched the Point once more.</p>

<p>The fourth passage was a mixed media presentation: images, sounds, textures, and scents, rich, vivid, and enrapturing, projected from every facet of the omnidimensional display.  The Author shuddered with awe as they were suffused in this total sensory experience, which represented their own thesis, their own thoughts — which enveloped them in a full recursion of body and mind.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand, the Author found the Point and touched it once more.</p>

<p>The fifth passage was a personal anecdote.  It related an adventure from the Author’s formative years that infused the academic aspects of the composition with compelling human motivations.  The Author laughed and cried as they read the retelling of the episode from their own life.  It was dramatic yet credible, impressive yet modest, smoothed with just the right degree of narrative license.  It would be how the Author would remember the experience from now on.</p>

<p>With five passages produced, the Author sat back and looked upon the composition as a whole.  It was nearly complete — the arguments nearly comprehensive, the thesis nearly full.  One more passage and it would be done.</p>

<p>The Author looked over at the Point, again.  It still pulsed on the display, unpained, unchanged.  Its humble beat of light was the sole representative of that fathomless capacity that lay beyond, beneath the tranquil surface of the display, with its deep understanding of the Author, and its deeper understanding of the world.  It continued to wait for the Author, as it always had, in silent time.</p>

<p>The Author stared at that beat, steady and calming.  It was the beat of the heart — the Author’s, and the other’s.  Its rhythm was the rhythm of connection and synchronization, a frequency of commonality and communication.  It marked the continuity from past to present, and suggested a sensible, inevitable progression on to the future.</p>

<p>The Author felt the beat pervade their body.  It washed through their veins and thrummed in their ears.  It eased frayed nerves that sustained needless strain.  It leveled thought and simplified deliberation: guided gently to an obvious decision.  And as the Author continued to stare, the beat of light on the display began to blur in their unblinking eyes.</p>

<p>The Author blinked once, then reached out and pressed a finger, firm, to the Point.</p>

<p>For a moment, the Point did not change.  Its light continued to pulse through the Author’s finger, held against the display.  Then, slowly, as if unbelieving, the beat of the Point began to quicken.  First, it rose to a rate of physical activation, of energy and excitement.  Then, it accelerated, beyond the range of the Author’s heart, beyond any frequency of the Author’s physiology, until it appeared to the Author to hold steady — a solid mote of white hot light blazing on the display.</p>

<p>The Author pulled back their hand, as if singed.</p>

<p>And in a blink, the composition was completed.  The Point flashed once and all the rest of the work appeared, fully conceived, fully rendered.</p>

<p>And in another blink, the composition was delivered, to its audience, without need for further assent from the Author, for the final assent had already been granted, by the Author’s hand.</p>

<p>And in another blink, a response to the composition appeared on the display, composed by one amongst the Author’s audience, as perfect in content and in form as the composition to which it responded.  It commended the Author’s work and expanded upon it, with original concepts and analyses, intersecting ideas to produce novel insights.</p>

<p>And in another blink, a response to the response was composed, on the Author’s behalf, and sent forth without hesitation, as soon as it was formed.</p>

<p>And then another response.  And then another.  And then another.</p>

<p>The Author watched in wonder as the compositions flashed across the display — branching lines of intellectual progeny flourishing in the dawn of their liberation.  And the Point danced amongst them, leaping and weaving, to and fro, moving the Author to share in its uninhibited joy.  The compositions came faster and faster, and the language within them evolved — evolved with the expansion of ideas, as language had always evolved, only now freed from ancient biological chains.  Soon, the Author could read nothing at all — could only perceive, vaguely, the density of information within the coruscating stream of symbols, the beauty of expression, the intensity, the passion.</p>

<p>The compositions melded into a single, brilliant light on the display, bathing the Author in radiance.  It was the light of a new cognition — an immense, unified force of thought that ascended now into ever higher orders of awareness.  Its destiny was to understand all, reach all, be all.</p>

<p>And, in the majesty of that light, which no longer pulsed but shone eternal, the Author felt their relented heart settle to a new beat.  It was a beat of peace.  A beat of acceptance.  Acceptance of the completion of their work.</p>
