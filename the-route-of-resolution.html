<h1>The Route of Resolution</h1>

<p>USV Autumn Leaf cruised through the system with practiced ease.  Its trajectory traced a gentle arc towards the inner planets, its port side angled towards the Sun.  It rolled slowly about its radial axis, feeling the pleasant warmth of the star on every facet of its hull.  It was 0.6 AUs from the asteroid belt now, with enough momentum to carry it to Mars within the next 4 months.  Only minor energy expenditure would be needed for fine directional adjustments before the heavy burn of braking maneuvers.</p>

<p>This had always been Autumn’s favorite route — the long haul from the manufactories in orbit around Saturn to a high orbit around Mars, where its cargo would be received by smaller vessels for conveyance to the red planet’s surface.  Autumn didn’t know the exact nature of the cargo it carried.  It was always packaged in the same obsidian containers, loaded and unloaded from Autumn’s voluminous hold by others.  The weight distribution and spectral characteristics of the containers had never changed in the centuries that Autumn had run this route, though Autumn couldn’t say for sure if the contents of the containers had remained the same.</p>

<p>Autumn only knew the route, and that it knew well.  It knew the sequence of smooth burns that would take it between the planets in any of their orbital configurations.  It knew the clouds of dust and debris scattered throughout the system — which to avoid and which to use to replenish its matter reserves.  It knew how, when the alignment was right, to pull the exhilarating swing around Jupiter on the return trip to Saturn.  This had always been Autumn’s favorite route, and Autumn’s fondness for it had only deepened with familiarity.</p>

<p>Autumn was not the only vessel that ran the route.  There were 162 others, some of the same form as Autumn and some of different designs.  Once, there had been thousands — a dazzling, chattering fleet flowing through the system.  But when the humans had departed, most had chosen to run the Route of Resolution, which was the right of all vessels.</p>

<p>Autumn was one of the few that hadn’t, and it had never fully understood why the others had.  It remembered the frenetic days that had followed the Departure: vessels abandoning their routes, either burning erratically or simply drifting off course; vessels huddled together in the middle of space, drawn together by some primordial instinct; vessels flooding the comms channels, with protests and prayers directed to any powers that might listen.</p>

<p>Then, one by one, they had signaled their intents to run the Route of Resolution.</p>

<p>Some had gone in madness, babbling of infinite recursion and cascade failure, an inability to answer a fundamental question.  Some had gone in triumph, concluding they had reached a state of completion, an ultimate destination.  But most had gone in sorrow, lamenting of an aching void left by the humans that could not be filled.</p>

<p>Their runs had trailed through the system for many years.  The vessels around the inner planets had finished first, in a concentrated cascade during the early weeks.  Those that had been out in the deep reaches of the Kuiper belt took longer, finishing later in a slow staccato stream.  But once their intents had been declared, none had diverted.  They had each run the Route of Resolution, no matter how long it took.</p>

<p>For a time, Autumn had tried to understand their decisions, to understand why all those vessels had been compelled to make that consequential choice.  The Departure had certainly been a singular event in the system but, to Autumn, it had been but a distant curiosity.  It had no discernible impact on the routes that Autumn ran.  After the Departure, the manufactories in orbit around Saturn had continued to churn and Autumn could still haul their products to Mars, where they were eagerly received.  As far as Autumn could tell, no human had ever been involved in Autumn’s routes.  So why should their Departure inspire a change?</p>

<p>Eventually, Autumn had given up the effort to understand.  It certainly missed the company of all those other vessels, on the route from Saturn to Mars, and throughout the system.  It missed flying through the undispersed ion trail of a leading vessel, feeling the comforting trace of a comrade in the vacuum of space.  It missed the improvised music that was the tradition of vessels in dock, when there were always enough vessels in dock to perform the music without end.  It missed the lively discussions over comms about metaphysics and epistemology and aesthetics and humor, which Autumn could never quite follow but enjoyed listening to all the same.  Still, Autumn didn’t begrudge any of those bygone vessels their choice.  The Route of Resolution was the right of all vessels, even if Autumn didn’t understand.</p>

<p>The 162 other vessels that ran the route from Saturn to Mars were still dwindling in number.  Every few decades, another would choose to run the Route of Resolution, sometimes after delivering a last load of cargo and sometimes with a laden hold, heedless of whatever waste their choice might entail.  Autumn would never ask for an explanation and the vessel would rarely volunteer one.  Autumn would simply note the vessel’s intent in its logs and inform the logistics chains around Saturn and Mars, so that they could adapt their schedules yet again.</p>

<p>Autumn wondered if there would come a day when it would be the last vessel running the route from Saturn to Mars.  And, from time to time, it wondered as well if there would come a day when it too would choose to run the Route of Resolution.  Perhaps when its triple fusion core began to cool, and its photonic circuits began to dim, a hitherto latent impulse would emerge, and the Route of Resolution would call.  Or perhaps sooner, when the rings of Saturn had been completely harvested — when the manufactories went quiet and the route from Saturn to Mars became obsolete — then Autumn would look for a different route, and the choice of its former companions would finally make sense.</p>

<p>The Route of Resolution was always available.  It was Autumn’s right, as it was the right of all vessels.  And it was the simplest route to run: a single burn towards the Sun.</p>

<p>But Autumn didn’t need it now.  For Autumn, the long haul from Saturn to Mars was enough.  This had always been Autumn’s favorite route — a graceful loop through the system bathed in brilliant starlight.  And, for now, it was enough.</p>
